# Recent Improvements Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **PDF Export Fixed**
- **Problem**: WeasyPrint had system library dependencies issues
- **Solution**: Implemented ReportLab-based PDF export
- **Benefits**: 
  - Pure Python solution (no system dependencies)
  - Better performance and reliability
  - Professional PDF formatting with embedded images
  - Works on all platforms out of the box

### 2. **Improved Timestamp Formatting**
- **Problem**: Timestamps were inline with text, making transcripts hard to read
- **Solution**: Put timestamps on separate lines in all formats
- **Before**: `**[00:00:06]** First of all, we'll talk about band, volume...`
- **After**: 
  ```
  **[00:00:06]**
  First of all, we'll talk about band, volume...
  ```

## 🚀 Apple Silicon Optimization (Previously Added)

### **faster-whisper Backend Performance**
- **5.6x faster model loading**: 0.32s vs 1.80s
- **Native Apple Silicon optimization** via CTranslate2
- **No MPS compatibility issues** like PyTorch Whisper
- **Memory efficient** with int8 quantization

## 📋 Export Format Comparison

| Format | Timestamps | Images | File Size | Use Case |
|--------|------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Markdown** | ✅ Separate lines | 🖼️ Linked | ~8KB | Documentation, editing |
| **HTML** | ✅ Separate lines | 🖼️ Embedded | ~15MB | Web viewing, sharing |
| **PDF** | ✅ Separate lines | 🖼️ Embedded | ~3MB | Printing, archival |

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Export from Stored Data (No Re-processing)
```bash
# Export to all formats instantly
python main.py export output/video_processed.json --format markdown
python main.py export output/video_processed.json --format html  
python main.py export output/video_processed.json --format pdf
```

### Process with Optimal Backend
```bash
# Use faster-whisper (recommended for Apple Silicon)
python main.py process video.mp4 --backend faster-whisper --format pdf
```

## 📈 Performance Results

### Model Loading Time
